## Overview

NovaXP's XP (Experience Points) system automatically tracks member activity and rewards engagement with XP, levels, and rewards.

## How XP Works

### Automatic Tracking

XP is awarded automatically for:

- **Messages**: Sending messages in text channels
- **Reactions**: Reacting to messages
- **Voice Activity**: Time spent in voice channels

### XP Calculation

#### Base XP

- **Range**: 15-25 XP per message (configurable)

## Level System

### Level Calculation

Levels are calculated based on:

- **Base XP Per Level**: 100 XP (configurable)

When you level up:

- **Notification**: You're notified of level up
